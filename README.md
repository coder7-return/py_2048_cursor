🎮 2048 in Python

This is a Python implementation of the classic 2048 game using the pygame library.

🚀 Getting Started

The game is distributed as a single Python file, game_2048.py, and requires Python 3.8+ and the pygame library.

Prerequisites

You'll need a suitable Python environment. It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment for dependency management.

1. Setup the Virtual Environment

Open your terminal or command prompt in the directory where you have the requirements.txt and game_2048.py files.

    Create the virtual environment (Linux/Windows):
    Bash

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

    Linux/macOS:
    Bash

source venv/bin/activate

Windows (Command Prompt):
Bash

venv\Scripts\activate.bat

Windows (PowerShell):
Bash

        venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

    (Your terminal prompt should now be prefixed with (venv))

2. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages using the provided requirements.txt file.
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Game

Execute the main Python file to start the game:
Bash

python game_2048.py

📦 Creating Executable Files (Windows & Linux)

To create a standalone executable file that doesn't require a user to install Python or dependencies, you can use a tool like PyInstaller.

1. Install PyInstaller

Ensure your virtual environment is still activated, and then install PyInstaller:
Bash

pip install pyinstaller

2. Generate the Executable

Use the following command to generate the executable. The --onefile flag creates a single executable file.
Bash

pyinstaller --onefile game_2048.py

3. Locating the Executable

After the command completes, the executable will be located in the newly created dist/ directory.

    On Windows: The file will be named game_2048.exe.

    On Linux: The file will be named game_2048 (no extension).

You can now distribute this single executable file for the respective platform.

    Note: PyInstaller must be run on the target platform (e.g., run PyInstaller on Windows to create a Windows executable, and on Linux to create a Linux executable).

🕹️ Controls

The game is controlled using the arrow keys on your keyboard:

    UP (↑)

    DOWN (↓)

    LEFT (←)

    RIGHT (→)

You can also use the following keys for actions:

    R → Restart the game

    Q or ESC → Quit the game
